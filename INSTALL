Assuming it's dependencies are met (see README) Visecas comes ready to run out
of the box. You don't have to install it in order to test it. 
Just cd into bin/ and issue ./visecas

If however you really want to install it this is how it goes:

ruby setup.rb config --prefix=/path/to/prefix
ruby setup.rb setup
ruby setup.rb install

The last step may require root privileges (depending on your prefix).

Files will be installed to

prefix/bin 					(visecas)
prefix/lib/ruby/site_ruby/RUBY.VERSION/visecas 	(lib/visecas)
prefix/share/visecas				(data/visecas)

NOTE however that the configuration step modifies some files. After that you
won't be able to run visecas from the source tree.

setup.rb does NOT provide an 'uninstall' target!
You can however use a tool like 'checkinstall' to generate a dummy package for
your distribution.
