Introduction
------------

Visecas is a graphical user interface for Ecasound <http://eca.cx/ecasound>, a
software package written by Kai Vehmanen <k@eca.cx> which is designed for
multitrack audio processing.
It starts Ecasound as a child process and communicates via a pipe using
Ecasound's InterActive Mode (IAM) commands.

Visecas is designed with GNOME's Human Interface Guidelines in mind.

See http://visecas.sourceforge.net for details.


Features
--------

* All arguments are passed on to Ecasound.
  You can start Visecas from the command line as you would start Ecasound.

* This implies that Visecas does not introduce another file format but can read
  and write ecs files (actually Ecasound reads and writes them itself).

* Every chainsetup of an Ecasound session is displayed in one toplevel window.

* Chains can be added, removed, renamed, muted and bypassed.

* Audio objects can be added, removed and connected.

* Chainoperators can be added, removed and controlled by
  dynamically created dialogs.

* The engine status is displayed and can be controlled.

* Ecasound's preferences can be edited.
